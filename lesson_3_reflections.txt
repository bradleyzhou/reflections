When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When I want to pubish the content to public, or to share it with other people.
    Also when I want to have a backup of the work in somewhere else than my local
    storage.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    I might be working on some branches. Automatic pulls might interfere with that
    by merging changes in the file(s) which I am working on.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    A fork is a GitHub clone, a convenient tool for reusing other's work. It's on 
    GitHub.
    A clone is a repository downloaded to local space (or if you run git clone on an
    online server, a somewhat 'remote' space).
    A branch is a copy of a state within a repository.
    I will use fork when I need to work based on other's previous work in GitHub.
    I will use a clone when I want to download and examine works done by others, or
    previously by myself. Also it could be useful for distributing works.
    I will use branches when I work something new within one repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    Git treats remote as a special branch. Storing infomation locally means one can 
    compare his/her changes without internet access. Also, for merges when pulling
    from remote, a local state is essential.
